It contains example pipelines and minimal code necessary for:
1. Calling variants from isolate clonal whole-genome sequencing data;
1. Calling variants from metagenomic whole-genome sequencing data;
1. Inferring lineages of descent and their frequencies through time.

These scripts may be used for similar inference of population dynamics 
from metagenomic and clonal sequencing data of microbial populations. However, 
it is not readily portable and would need to be appropriately edited. See research 
article for details on the inference steps.

Raw sequencing reads were uploaded to NCBI SRA under accession PRJNA865262.
