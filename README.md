# PIPELINES FOR XXX
This repo accompanies the research article "title title" by 
Artur Rego-Costa, I-Ting Huang1, Michael M. Desai, Andreas K. Gombert (2022).

It contains example pipelines and minimal code necessary for:
1. Calling variants from isolate clonal whole-genome sequencing data;
1. Calling variants from metagenomic whole-genome sequencing data;
1. Inferring lineages of descent and their frequencies through time.

The code is not expected to be readily functional to the user, as dependencies, paths and 
hardcoded values would need to be appropriately adjusted.

Raw sequencing reads were uploaded to NCBI SRA under accession PRJNA865262.
